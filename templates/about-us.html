           <p class="h5"><b>eVoting</b>, also known as Electronic Voting, is the flagship service of the Right2Vote platform, an eVoting solution approved by the Government of India. Let's explore the meaning of eVoting and 
            the various types of eVoting technologies used globally with <b>WeVote</b>.
            </p>
            <h5 class="pt-4">What is eVoting?</h5>
            <p>eVoting or electronic voting encompasses several terms including mVoting (Mobile Voting),
                rVoting (Remote Voting) and iVoting (Internet Voting). Essentially, eVoting refers to voting
                electronically via the internet. The voting medium can be any internet-enabled device, such as a
                mobile phone, computer or laptop. Typically, eVoting allows voters to cast their ballots remotely,
                eliminating the need to visit a specific polling booth.</p>
            <h5 class="pt-3">Mobile Voting or mVoting</h5>
            <p class="text-start">1. Voter still has to visit the booth to vote <br>
                2. Voting agency need to provide physical device and set up booths for the voters to be
                able to vote. This makes iVoting very costly and unaffordable for most organizations</p>
            <p class="text-start">To solve these problems, mobile voting or voting with the help of mobile devices came into being.
                Now voter can vote from any device from anywhere. The voter need not visit the booth to vote,
                and the voting agency need not provide costly equipment to the voters to be able to vote. Voter
                can vote directly from their mobile phones / tabs / laptops, or any other internet enabled device.
                </p>

                <p class="text-start">~ We are a VOTING focused platform. We are not a market survey tool like Survey Monkey or opinion poll tool like poll daddy. Hence, we are also very focused on SECURITY and AUTHENICATION, unlike market survey or polling platforms where these are not major concern area.<br>
                ~ We are a INDIA focused company. We would first like to make meaningful difference in our country before venturing abroad.<br>
                ~ We are an ETHICS focused organization and would not take short cuts.<br>
                ~ We are an EFFICIENCY focused organization. We believe internet allows us to do most activity in much more cost, time and effort efficient way and its foolish to ignore efficiency.<br>
                ~ We are a CUSTOMER focused organization and both voter and election manager are our customer. We are focused on ensuring that every voter gets his Right2Vote and his experience of voting is very easy and efficient in terms of cost, time and effort required. We are also focused that election holding process for the election manager should be very easy and efficient.<br>
                ~ We are a PROFIT focused business which focuses on bottom-line rather than the topline. We do not understand the current way of doing business where companies worth billions of dollars, to survive, need to beg in front of investors every year. Many people mistake us for a charitable organization, which is not true. Our aim is to do remarkable service to the society but at the same time, we do not want to risk our survival by not focusing on profit.</p>
